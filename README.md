# Max Verstappen — Unofficial Fan Site

An unofficial fan website dedicated to 4-time Formula 1 World Champion Max Verstappen. Built with React + Vite and deployed to Vercel. Features an F1 broadcast-inspired design with Red Bull Racing branding, his complete Red Bull car collection, career timeline, records, an interactive sphere photo gallery, live F1 telemetry, and the 2026 race calendar.

**Live site:** deployed to Vercel (auto-deploys from `main`)

| 📡 **Live Telemetry** (`/telemetry`) | F1 broadcast-style live race dashboard powered by the OpenF1 API — speed, gear, RPM, throttle, brake, DRS, gaps (leader/ahead/behind), last + best lap, sector times with PB coloring, tyre compound/age, pit windows, weather (air/track temp, humidity, wind, rain), and a race-long position timeline. All data is for Max Verstappen (driver #3). |
| 📅 **2026 Calendar** (`/calendar`) | Full 22-round 2026 F1 season calendar with dates, circuits, session timings, and completed race results (R1–R8) via an interactive detail panel |

### Design

- **F1 broadcast aesthetic** — dark track-surface backgrounds, telemetry-style counters, chevron speed lines
- **Red Bull Racing palette** — navy, hot orange-red accent, warm gold highlights (oklch perceptual color tokens)
- **Typography** — Formula1 Display (official F1 CDN typeface) for headings/numbers, Inter for body copy
- **Fully responsive** — mobile-first from 360px up through tablet (768px) and desktop (1280px)
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** respected — animations gracefully degrade

## 🎨 Theme Tokens

Colors use **oklch** perceptual uniformity for consistent contrast across lightness ranges. The seven canonical Red Bull brand hex values are defined as the source of truth; the oklch tokens are the perceptually-uniform variants used in the UI.

| Token | Value | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `--navy-blue` | `#0600EF` | Brand navy |
| `--dark-navy` | `#040099` | Brand dark navy |
| `--light-navy` | `#3a3aff` | Brand light navy |
| `--red` | `#FF0000` / oklch(58% 0.19 35) | Brand red / hot orange-red accent |
| `--yellow` | `#FFD700` / oklch(92% 0.04 70) | Brand yellow / warm gold highlight |
| `--track-black` | oklch(12% 0.015 250) | Page background |
| `--asphalt` | oklch(16% 0.02 250) | Card / section surfaces |
| `--carbon` | oklch(20% 0.02 250) | Raised surfaces |

Full token set (including type, spacing, motion, and shadows) lives in `src/styles/theme.css`.

## 📡 Live Telemetry — How It Works

The `/telemetry` dashboard is built on the public [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org), called
**directly from the visitor's browser** — there is no server, proxy, or auth token. Vercel
serves only the static bundle; every client hits `api.openf1.org` on its own IP.

OpenF1's free tier allows **3 requests/second and 30 requests/minute per IP**. A naïve
implementation (polling every 4 seconds a bundle of 6–7 endpoints at once) trips 429s
immediately. The telemetry hook (`src/hooks/useOpenF1.js`) is therefore designed around a
**deterministic slot scheduler** that keeps every visitor safely under both limits:

- **One request every 5 seconds**, round-robin across a 12-slot / 60-second cycle.
- **Per-endpoint cadence matches how fast the data actually changes:**
  `car_data` (speed / gear / RPM / DRS / throttle / brake) × 6/min — keeps a
  "live feel"; `intervals` (gaps) × 2/min; `laps` / `position` / `weather` / `pit`
  × 1/min — they only change per-lap or slower. Total: **12 requests/min**, one-third
  of the free-tier ceiling, with 3× headroom left for user-triggered manual
  refreshes.
- **Cursor-based incremental fetching** for `car_data` (the heaviest endpoint, ~34k
  samples for a full race): the first pull fetches the history, every subsequent pull
  sends `date>=<lastSampleTime>` so only the new samples come back. This drops
  bandwidth from hundreds of MB per race to a few KB per poll.
- **Ring buffer caps `car_data` at 500 samples** so memory stays bounded over a long
  weekend.
- **Startup priming burst** (4 sequential requests, 1 per second, under the 3/s limit)
  draws the dashboard into a ready state in ~3 seconds instead of waiting for the
  next slow-slot cycle.
- **Visibility-aware throttling**: when the tab is backgrounded, cadence drops to 1
  request / 60 seconds; returning fires an instant catch-up tick and restores 5s.
- **Session management**: the hook discovers the current/recent race session on
  mount, re-resolves the session list every 30 minutes to pick up rollovers, and
  automatically stops polling when a session is more than 30 minutes past its end
  or returns 3 consecutive empty responses.
- **Per-slot AbortController** with an unused-slot carry trap — each tick cancels any
  in-flight request before dispatching the next, fixing the stale-abort leak that
  existed in the original polling design.

End result for the visitor: one request landing every 5 seconds on their own IP,
never bulldozing OpenF1's free tier.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to a GitHub repository
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite — no manual config needed
4. Click **Deploy**

Or via the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Build command: `npm run build` · Output directory: `dist`

The `public/_redirects` file ensures Vercel serves `index.html` for all routes (required for SPA client-side routing).
